[NETWORK]
Containers can actualy talk to each other through their private network, but they need to
specify a public host to be able to talk with another container(which have already a exposed public port)
that its not on the same private network.

"Batteries included but removable" -> the networks already comes with default configuration but
you can change it whatever you want it.

**DEFAULT NETWORKS
- Bridge -> default docker network, which is NAT'ed behind the Host Ip.
- Host -> connect the container directly to the Host interface.
- None -> removes the eth0 and leaves you with localhost interface only.  

**DNS
It's not a good pratice use the containers IPs for talk to each other. The recommended way
is create your own custom newtork and then use their names as their DNS addresses.

[IMAGE]
Bunch of app binaries, dependencies, metadata and how to run your container.
DockerHub -> default repository to download open source images.

**LAYERS
Every command on some build image will create a unique layer with a ID, which
can be used multiple times without create another one every time a image is build
with the same previous commands.

**TAGS
The same image ID can have multiple tags attached to it, but these tags doesn't mean
that they will change the image ID.

**DOCKERFILE
Each RUN command creates a new image layer, so when we run multiple it's a good pratice
chain then with the keyword '&&', creating one unique layer given many commands as we which.
Example:
    """RUN apt-get update \"""
    """&& apt-get install docker \"""
    """&& apt-get install docker-compose"""

[PERSISTENT DATA]

**VOLUMES
The docker way to persist the container data event if the container is removed.
Named Volumes: friendly way to assign volumes to containers.
Example:
    """docker container run -d -v mysql-db:/var/lib/mysql mysql"""

**BIND MOUTING
Maps a host path(some path on your local machine) to the container given path.
