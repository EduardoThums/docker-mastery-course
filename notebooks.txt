[NETWORK CONCEPTS]
Containers can actualy talk to each other through their private network, but they need to
specify a public host to be able to talk with another container(which have already a exposed public port)
that its not on the same private network.

"Batteries included but removable" -> the networks already comes with default configuration but
you can change it whatever you want it.
