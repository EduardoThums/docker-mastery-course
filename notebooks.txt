[NETWORK]
Containers can actualy talk to each other through their private network, but they need to
specify a public host to be able to talk with another container(which have already a exposed public port)
that its not on the same private network.

"Batteries included but removable" -> the networks already comes with default configuration but
you can change it whatever you want it.

**DEFAULT NETWORKS
- Bridge -> default docker network, which is NAT'ed behind the Host Ip.
- Host -> connect the container directly to the Host interface.
- None -> removes the eth0 and leaves you with localhost interface only.  

**DNS
It's not a good pratice use the containers IPs for talk to each other. The recommended way
is create your own custom newtork and then use their names as their DNS addresses.
